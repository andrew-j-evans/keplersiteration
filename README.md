# Read Me for keplersiteration
keplersiteration, as the name implies, uses kepler's method of iteration to determine the change in variables of an orbit over a set amount of time. These variables include, position and velocity vectors, the six classical orbital elements, specifical mechanical energy, and specific angular momentum. These values are determined by iterating using step sizes of 0.1, 1, 10, 60, and 300, to analyze the variation of results due to larger time steps.
## Status

## How to Use
- Download the [keplersiteration.zip] folder and extract its contents to your computer
- Open the keplersiteration folder and open the file called keplersiteration.m
- Change the values for the inital position and velocity vectors to view what their final orbital components will be.
